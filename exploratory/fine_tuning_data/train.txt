fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_6.wav|There was no hope for him this time it was the third stroke|4.48
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_7.wav|Night after night I had passed the house it was vacation time and studied the lighted square of window and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way faintly and evenly|12.736009070294784
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_8.wav|If he was dead I thought I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse|9.856009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_9.wav|He had often said to me I am not long for this world and I had thought his words idle|6.4
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_10.wav|Now I knew they were true|2.56
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_11.wav|Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis|6.1440362811791385
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_12.wav|It had always sounded strangely in my ears like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism|8.96
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_13.wav|But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being|5.504036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_14.wav|It filled me with fear and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work|6.4
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_15.wav|Old Cotter was sitting at the fire smoking when I came downstairs to supper|4.608027210884353
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_16.wav|While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said as if returning to some former remark of his  No I wouldnt say he was exactly  but there was something queer  there was something uncanny about him|13.44
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_17.wav|Ill tell you my opinion  He began to puff at his pipe no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind|6.272018140589569
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_18.wav|Tiresome old fool|1.92
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_19.wav|When we knew him first he used to be rather interesting talking of faints and worms but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery|9.728027210884354
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_20.wav|I have my own theory about it he said|2.56
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_21.wav|I think it was one of those  peculiar cases|2.752018140589569
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_22.wav|But its hard to say  He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory|5.632018140589569
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_23.wav|My uncle saw me staring and said to me  Well so your old friend is gone youll be sorry to hear|6.272018140589569

fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_30.wav|I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me|5.888027210884354

fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_33.wav|The old chap taught him a great deal mind you and they say he had a great wish for him|4.736009070294784

fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_35.wav|Old Cotter looked at me for a while|2.8160090702947844
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_36.wav|I felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate|7.68
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_37.wav|He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate|4.16
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_38.wav|I wouldnt like children of mine he said to have too much to say to a man like that|5.632018140589569

fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_47.wav|And thats what stands to me now|2.1760090702947847
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_48.wav|Education is all very fine and large Mr Cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton he added to my aunt|7.36
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_49.wav|No no not for me said old Cotter|3.2
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_50.wav|My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table|4.096009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_51.wav|But why do you think its not good for children Mr Cotter|3.5840362811791384
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_52.wav|she asked|1.2160090702947846
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_53.wav|Its bad for children said old Cotter because their minds are so impressionable|5.44
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_54.wav|When children see things like that you know it has an effect  I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger|8.51201814058957
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_55.wav|Tiresome old rednosed imbecile|3.264036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_56.wav|It was late when I fell asleep|2.4960090702947846
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_57.wav|Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences|8.576009070294784
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_58.wav|In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic|6.1440362811791385
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_59.wav|I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas|4.096009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_60.wav|But the grey face still followed me|2.88
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_61.wav|It murmured and I understood that it desired to confess something|3.9680272108843537
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_62.wav|I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region and there again I found it waiting for me|7.296009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_63.wav|It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle|9.216009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_64.wav|But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin|9.088027210884354
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_65.wav|The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street|5.3120181405895694
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_66.wav|It was an unassuming shop registered under the vague name of Drapery|5.12
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_67.wav|The drapery consisted mainly of childrens bootees and umbrellas and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window saying Umbrellas Recovered|10.24
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_68.wav|No notice was visible now for the shutters were up|3.4560090702947845
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_69.wav|A crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker with ribbon|4.096009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_70.wav|Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape|5.632018140589569
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_71.wav|I also approached and read       July 1st 1895      The Rev|6.016009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_72.wav|James Flynn formerly of S Catherines      Church Meath Street aged sixtyfive years|7.424036281179139
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_73.wav|R|1.0240362811791384
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_74.wav|I P  The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check|8.256009070294784
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_75.wav|Had he not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his armchair by the fire nearly smothered in his greatcoat|9.664036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_76.wav|Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze|7.68
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_77.wav|It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuffbox for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor|9.856009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_78.wav|Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat|7.872018140589569
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_79.wav|It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief blackened as it always was with the snuffstains of a week with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains was quite inefficacious|18.688027210884353
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_80.wav|I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock|3.84
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_81.wav|I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as I went|8.064036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_82.wav|I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death|12.416009070294784
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_83.wav|I wondered at this for as my uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal|5.376009070294785
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_84.wav|He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly|5.504036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_85.wav|He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest|10.624036281179139
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_86.wav|Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections|13.568027210884354
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_87.wav|His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts|8.448027210884353
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_88.wav|The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate questions|24.768027210884355
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_89.wav|Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice|9.984036281179138
fine_tuning_data/recording_sentence_90.wav|Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart and as I pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately|15.296009070294785
